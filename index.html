My project is about energy measurement in wireless networks (details covered in Education below). I have four years of experience covering various aspects of IT services and computer networks, starting from assembling new systems to finding practical solutions for diverse problems that may occur in networks systems, also tackling problems related to Microsoft services and the Cisco platform.</p>

      <p>Pishtazan Andisheh Pouya is located in Iran and provides IT services to other companies. My responsibilities as a network specialist were to setup a reliable LAN network and making sure that it was working properly.
We had two Proliant HP servers and we were experiencing delays in our inbound and outbound traffic. I investigated the cause and found that the resources available to the servers were not being utilised efficiently due to the lack of a proper load balancing policy on the singular port in use (out of several available). Having used virtualisation previously, I conducted some experiments on my laptop and based on the results suggested we could virtualise our servers to have a more efficient network. After this, I installed ESX5.5 and created the VMs. I installed Microsoft server 2012 on them an added various services and roles like Active Directory, DNS, DHCP. Some branches were located out of town (e.g a warehouse), hence I added the RRAS role and set up a VPN server so that users from these remote offices could connect securely to our network. Kaspersky security center and Kerio control were installed to control and monitor the network and users' security and internet usage management respectively (importing groups and users from Active Directory). </p>

        <p>This company is positioned in Tehran, Iran and develops diverse software according to their customers' requirements. I started as an intern in the IT department as a network supporter.
I was tasked with backing up users' data and related systems via Acronis True Image or Norton Ghost along with the deployment of essential network services like Exchange server or Lync Serve.
Due to pre-existing problems in the workgroup, I suggested a change to the workgroup environment, moving it to a unified domain behpardaz.net, which provided authorised access to the shared files and folders, increased the security by applying domain-wide policies. I installed Microsoft 2008 on our servers and added roles and services like Active Directory, DNS, DHCP. 
There was a requirement for connecting specific clients from different physical locations, I proposed the creation of VLANs for each department and set the interVLAN routing configuration on our Catalyst 3750 switch. Following this, I installed Cisco CUCM on a virtual server (ESX5) to reduce the cost of phone calls as well as the accessibility of the staff regardless of their location.</p>

      <p>My project is about energy measurement in wireless networks and how situational awareness(SA) can reduce the energy consumption in an ad-hoc network in a home environment by making rational decisions according to the data elicited by intelligent sensors. Several modules in my master degree were crucial in helping me fulfill this goal - Sensors and IoT, WLAN technologies, network modeling and performance that cover various aspects of a wireless network implementation. </p>
